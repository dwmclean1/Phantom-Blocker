# Phantom-Blocker
Passive Phantom Power blocking in an XLR barrel

## What is it?

This tiny PCB can be used inline on an XLR mixer input to protect the connected device from accidental enabling of phantom power.

It will _just_ fit inside a cheap XLR barrel.

Included are gerbers and CSV BOM which can be used to have the board manufactured with components by JLCPCB.
